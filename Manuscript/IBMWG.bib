abstract = {Limited data, and the requirement to provide science-based advice for exploited populations, have led to the development of statistical methods that combine several sources of information into a single analysis. This approach, “integrated analysis”, was first formulated by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Contemporary use of integrated analysis involves using all available data, in as raw a form as appropriate, in a single analysis. Analyses that were traditionally carried out independently are now conducted simultaneously through likelihood functions that include multiple data sources. For example, the traditional analysis of converting catch-at-length data into catch-at-age data for use in an age-structured population dynamics models can be avoided by including the basic data used in this conversion, length-frequency and conditional age-at-length data, in the likelihood function. This allows for consistency in assumptions and permits the uncertainty associated with both data sources to be propagated to final model outputs, such as catch limits under harvest control rules. The development of the AD Model Builder software has greatly facilitated the use of integrated analyses, and there are now several general stock assessment models (e.g., Stock Synthesis) that allow many data types and model assumptions to be analyzed simultaneously. In this paper, we define integrated analysis, describe its history and development, give several examples, and describe the advantages of and problems with integrated analysis.}

The eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS) cod fishery, which displays the retrospective problem, and simulated data are analysed to provide insight into the causes and potential solutions to this problem. The retrospective problem is shown to be a result of the traditional analysis techniques and a non-stationarity in the data used in the population analysis. A moving window analysis is developed which allows the non-stationarities to be identified and in some cases rectified. Recommendations are also made for ad hoc investigations of the data. The analysis suggests that failure to correct the retrospective problem for a stock with data like ESS cod could lead to catch-level advice that would be twice or more the intended level.}",

abstract = {Abstract Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

It is important for such assessments to be peer-reviewed and to pass scientific scrutiny before they can be used to inform management decision making. While it is desirable for management decisions to be based on quantitative assessments that use as much of the available data as possible, this is not always the case. A proposed assessment may be found to be unsatisfactory during the peer-review process (even if it utilizes all of the available data), leading to decisions being made using simpler approaches. This paper provides a synthesis across seven jurisdictions of the types of diagnostic statistics and plots that can be used to evaluate whether a proposed assessment is ‘best available science’, summarizes several cases where a proposed assessment was not accepted for use in management, and how jurisdictions are able to provide management advice when a stock assessment is ‘rejected.’ The paper concludes with recommended general practices for reducing subjectivity when deciding whether to accept an assessment and how to provide advice when a proposed assessment is rejected.}

abstract = {The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two approaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework. We fit models with and without (independent or autocorrelated) random effects on NAA, M, and selectivity to data from five stocks with a broad range of life history, fishing pressure, number of ages, and time-series length. Models that included random effects performed well across stocks and processes, especially random effects models with a two dimensional (2D) first-order autoregressive, AR(1), covariance structure over age and year. We conducted simulation tests and found negligible or no bias in estimation of important assessment outputs (SSB, F, stock status, and catch) when the operating and estimation models matched. However, bias in SSB and F was often non-trivial when the estimation model was less complex than the operating model, especially when models without random effects were fit to data simulated from models with random effects. Bias of the variance and correlation parameters controlling random effects was also negligible or slightly negative as expected. Our results suggest that WHAM can be a useful tool for stock assessment when environmental effects on R or M, or stochastic variation in NAA transitions, M, or selectivity are of interest. In the U.S. Northeast, where the productivity of several groundfish stocks has declined, conducting assessments in WHAM with time-varying processes via random effects or environment-productivity links may account for these trends and potentially reduce retrospective bias.}

We retrospectively evaluated the ability of data-limited methods to set target catches close to the overfishing limit for data-rich stocks in the Northeast U.S. Methods explored include options that would be used in truly data-poor cases (i.e., catch-only methods), but we also evaluated methods with different data requirements for stocks that have information beyond a catch time series. The majority of options we explored that used average catches over some portion of the time period, or adjusted the recent catches based on trends in an index were sensitive to the level of historical exploitation. Such methods produced target catches above the overfishing limit for stocks that had a history of overfishing, or target catches that were overly conservative for stocks with a history of light exploitation. Careful consideration of the level of historical exploitation rates, if possible, is therefore needed if using such approaches are to be applied. Catch curve methods, which require catch-at-age information, were the only approaches not sensitive to the level of historical exploitation, and were largely effective at setting target catches close to the overfishing limit, even for stocks with intense historical exploitation rates. However, there were cases where catch curve methods produced unsustainable target catches, particularly for stocks with episodic recruitments, such that care is needed when implementing catch curve methods.}

However, M is rarely constant in reality as a result of the combined impacts of exploitation history, predation, environmental factors, and physiological trade-offs. Misspecification or poor estimation of M can lead to bias in quantities estimated using stock assessment methods, potentially resulting in biased estimates of fishery reference points and catch limits, with the magnitude of bias being influenced by life history and trends in fishing mortality. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the ability of statistical age-structured population models to estimate spawning-stock biomass, fishing mortality, and total allowable catch when the true M was age-invariant, but time-varying. Configurations of the stock assessment method, implemented in Stock Synthesis, included a single age- and time-invariant M parameter, specified at one of the three levels (high, medium, and low) or an estimated M. The min–max (i.e. most robust) approach to specifying M when it is thought to vary across time was to estimate M. The least robust approach for most scenarios examined was to fix M at a high value, suggesting that the consequences of misspecifying M are asymmetric.}",

abstract = {Natural mortality (M) is often considered to be one of the most important parameters in a fish stock assessment and affects productivity estimates for the population. However, it is also among the most difficult parameters to estimate using commonly available data. The magnitude of error (both bias and variance) when estimating this parameter can be substantial and can be affected by ignoring its variation over time, space, age, and length. In this study we explore the implications of errors in M on estimation and management performance using simulations and illustrative examples. The error in management reference points such as F35% and FMSY is related directly to the error associated with M. Estimates of biomass are expected to be positively biased when M is over-estimated and vice versa. Use of feedback management strategies reduces the impact of errors in M, but performance in meeting management objectives is compromised when M is in error. Estimating M was found to perform better than pre-specifying M in closed-loop simulations. Also, we found that the consequences of setting M to an incorrect value were reduced if stock-recruitment steepness was estimated. Based on our study and a review of related work, we advocate estimating M within an assessment, ideally with a prior for M tailored to the stock concerned.}

abstract = {Fisheries co-management processes must provide a mechanism for industry stakeholder involvement in decision-making, while also providing assurance that precautionary actions will be taken to conserve fish stocks into the future. We used a management strategy evaluation approach to evaluate practical harvest policies suggested by industry stakeholders in a co-managed fishery for sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) in British Columbia, Canada. These harvest policies included (i) data-based procedures that average recent catch limits with a smoothed research survey index of abundance and (ii) model-based procedures that rely on annual catch-at-age stock assessment modeling to estimate stock biomass. Both approaches attempt to implement constant exploitation rate harvest policies. We evaluated these procedures in four simulation scenarios that encompassed some important uncertainties related to current stock size and productivity. Both procedure types performed close to a perfect-information procedure in terms of catch, catch variability, and conservation, provided that exploitation rate policy parameters were set close to their optimal values. The smoothing function used in data-based procedures caused lags in which declines (increases) in catch limits extended for longer periods than declines (increases) in stock biomass. However, these lags did not create long-term adverse effects on performance. Model-based procedures generally performed better in terms of catch and inter-annual variability in catch. Interactions between harvest policy exploitation rates and stock assessment model biases caused similar lags as those of data-based procedures, although such biases also did not degrade performance severely. Our results, combined with empirical experience elsewhere suggest that data-based management procedures provide an appealing and practical means of setting annual catch limits either in the absence of an accepted model-based approach, or preferably, in combination with periodic stock assessment modeling. Such an approach provides transparency in a co-management process, while sacrificing little in terms of long-term conservation and utilization.}

    abstract = { Traditionally, the natural mortality rate (M) in a stock assessment is assumed to be constant. When M increases within an assessment, the question arises how to change the fishing mortality rate target (FTarget). Per recruit considerations lead to an increase in FTarget, while limiting total mortality leads to a decrease in FTarget. Application of either approach can result in nonsensical results. Short-term gains in yield associated with high FTarget values should be considered in light of potential losses in future yield if the high total mortality rate leads to a decrease in recruitment. Examples using yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are used to demonstrate that FTarget can change when M increases within an assessment and to illustrate the consequences of different FTarget values. When a change in M within an assessment is contemplated, first consider the amount and strength of empirical evidence to support the change. When the empirical evidence is not strong, we recommend using a constant M. If strong empirical evidence exists, we recommend estimating FTarget for a range of stock–recruitment relationships and evaluating the trade-offs between risk of overfishing and forgone yield. }

The Rose approach is an ensemble of models that all remove the retrospective pattern through changes in data, parameter values, or model assumptions. It is time intensive and can result in a wide range of historical abundance trends. The Rho approach modifies the terminal year estimates of a single model that exhibits a retrospective pattern. It is fast and easy to apply but results in a discontinuous time series. Neither approach identifies the source of the retrospective pattern. The pros and cons of these two approaches are compared in terms of catch advice and stock status using four examples with varying strength and direction of retrospective patterns. The choice of which approach to use could be based on time and expertise available to conduct and maintain an assessment, with Rose preferred if a lot of both are available while Rho preferred otherwise. If the Rho approach is used, managers should consider adjusting their control rule or risk buffer to account for the difference between Rose and Rho results shown here.}",
